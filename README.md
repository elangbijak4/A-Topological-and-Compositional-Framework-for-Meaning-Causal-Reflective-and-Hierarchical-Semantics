# A Topological and Compositional Framework for Meaning

## Context

This repository hosts a foundational research paper developed under the **Almudaya Research Institute**.  
The work investigates the structural nature of meaning by proposing an axiomatic and representation-agnostic framework grounded in topology and compositional interpretation.

The research is motivated by a simple but far-reaching question:

> *What kind of structure must meaning have in order to support causality, relational interpretation, and hierarchy without collapsing into a single representational space?*

## Research Orientation (Almudaya Perspective)

Almudaya Research Institute approaches artificial intelligence and semantics from a **foundational and long-horizon perspective**.  
Rather than optimizing representations or proposing new architectures, Almudaya focuses on:

- epistemic clarity before empirical optimization,
- axiomatic structure before implementation,
- limits and principles before performance.

This work reflects that orientation by treating meaning as a **structural phenomenon** that emerges from connectivity and interpretation, not merely from representation or similarity.

## Summary of the Work

The paper introduces the concept of a **meaning topology** as a general semantic space in which meaning arises through structured relations rather than metric proximity alone.

Within a meaning topology, two irreducible modes of semantic interpretation are distinguished:

- **Causal Meaning**  
  Meaning arising from direct participation in generative or causal subgraphs.

- **Reflective Meaning**  
  Meaning arising from interpretative mappings across the semantic space, independent of causal adjacency.

These two modes are shown to be structurally non-equivalent, potentially coexisting, and insufficiently captured by any single reflection operator.

Building on this foundation, the work formalizes the **hierarchy of meaning** not as internal stratification within a single space, but as **compositional mapping between distinct meaning topologies**.  
This formulation imposes no assumptions of inclusion, complexity ordering, or linear abstraction.

## Conceptual Contributions

- An axiomatic definition of *meaning topology* as a foundational semantic structure.
- A formal distinction between causal and reflective modes of meaning.
- Proofs establishing the non-equivalence and coexistence of these modes.
- A demonstration that metric embedding spaces are restricted special cases of reflective meaning.
- A proof of the non-existence of a universal reflection operator.
- A general, representation-agnostic formulation of hierarchical meaning as compositional mapping.
- Epistemic and ontological implications for semantic modeling and artificial intelligence.

## Scope and Non-Goals

This repository contains **formal and theoretical research only**.

It intentionally does **not** provide:
- machine learning models,
- training or evaluation pipelines,
- datasets or benchmarks,
- software libraries or APIs.

The purpose of this work is to clarify **foundational structures and limits**.  
Any applied or empirical instantiation is left as a separate and downstream endeavor.
